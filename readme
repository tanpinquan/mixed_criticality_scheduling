Two mixed-criticality algortihms are implemented
- EDF-VDF
- ER-EDF

The requirements to run it are:
- python 3.7
- simpy 3.0.11
- numpy 1.18.1
- scipy 1.4.1
- matplotlib 3.1.3
- cycler 0.10.0

The files are structed in this way:

EDF-VD.py - This generates a random EDF-VD taskset and schedule according to the parameters in the report. Run to generate a taskset and plot it out
EDF-VD_service_rate.py - This measures the service rate for EDF-VD. Run to measure and plot service rate

ER-EDF.py - This generates a random ER-EDF taskset and schedule according to the parameters in the report. Run to generate a taskset and plot it out
ER-EDF_service_rate.py - This measures the service rate for ER-EDF. Run to measure and plot service rate

TasksetCompare.py - This generates the distribution of taskset lengths for regular EDF, EDF-VD, and ER-EDF

TasksetGenerator.py - This contains functions to generate EDF-VD and ER-EDF tasksets. Not used directly
VisualizeTasks.py - This contains functions to plot out generated schedules. Not used directly
